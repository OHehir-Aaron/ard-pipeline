To get started,
```
$ module use /g/data/v10/public/modules/modulefiles
$ module load dea/20200617  # whatever dea_version is in module-config.yaml
```
then
```
$ python3 configure.py
$ cd scripts
$ chmod +x cleanup.bash setup.bash
$ ./setup.bash
```
The `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` line in the module-script needs to be commented out when compiling, but then uncommented when
running in the deployed copy.

In case something goes wrong, run
```
$ ./cleanup.bash
```
in the scripts folder and start over.
